<!-- Text Case Swapper

Tired of accidentally hitting my capslock button and typing for a while, THEN going to VSCode and doing the transform > to X option every time, I made this script. 

Setup:
======

1) Clone the git repository to wherever you'd like.

2) Open this folder in Terminal and run 'chmod 777 tch.sh' to make it executable.

3) Simply use the command './tcw' to be prompted for the text to transform (just paste it), and the transformation operation. Finally press any key to exit.

4) Use this script often? Consider adding it to your $PATH.

Cheers! -->
